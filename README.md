# Network Automation using Python and Ansible

This project focuses on automating network configuration, management, and monitoring tasks using Ansible and Python. It simplifies repetitive network operations, enhances consistency, and reduces human errors.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

- Ansible 2.9+

## Version History

### v1.2 (Latest)
- New: Added backup capability.
```python
def create_backup_log(hosts, commands):
    """Create a backup log file in the Downloads folder."""
    downloads_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Downloads")
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
    backup_filename = f"config_backup_{timestamp}.txt"
    backup_filepath = os.path.join(downloads_path, backup_filename)
    
    try:
        with open(backup_filepath, "w") as backup_file:
            for host in hosts:
                backup_file.write(f"Device IP: {host['hostname']}\n")
                backup_file.write("Commands Executed:\n")
                backup_file.write("\n".join(commands) + "\n\n")
        print(f"üìÇ Backup saved: {backup_filepath}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error saving backup: {e}")
```
### v1.1
- New: Added ping before establishing SSH session.
```python
def ping_host(hostname):
    """Ping a host to check if it is reachable."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["ping", "-n", "1", hostname], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        return result.returncode == 0  # 0 means the host is reachable
    except Exception:
        return False

for host in hosts:
        hostname = host['hostname']
        print(f'üîé Pinging {hostname}...')
        if ping_host(hostname):
            print(f'‚úÖ {hostname} is reachable. Proceeding with configuration...')
            push_ios_config(host['hostname'], host['username'], host['password'], config_commands)
        else:
            print(f'‚ùå {hostname} is unreachable. Skipping configuration.')
```
### v1.0
