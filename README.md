Ansible and NAPALM Samples

This GitHub Repo focuses on comparing Ansible and NAPALM on Cisco NX-OS and Arista EOS.

Ansible is powerful automation software that you can learn quickly. Ansible is an open source project, Ansible Engine is the product you can buy enterprise support for. NAPALM is actually a Python library that implements a set of functions to interact with different router vendor devices using a unified API. NAPLAM isn't a product, but rather another open source project with a community behind it. While many networking use-cases can potentially overlap the two tools augment each other rather than compete directly. There are even NAPALM Ansible modules.
